# Analyze-AB-Test-Results-

> An e-commerce company has developed a new web page in order to try and increase the number of users who "convert," meaning the number of users who decide to pay for the company's product. The goal is to work through this notebook to help the company understand if they should implement this new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.

The main goal of this project was to understand the results of an A/B test run by the website and provide statistical and practical interpretation on the test results.
